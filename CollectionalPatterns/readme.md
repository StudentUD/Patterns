# Collectional Patterns
  - Deal with the details of how to compose classes and objects to form larger structures.

  * [Composite](composite/readme.md)
    - Allows both individual objects and composite objects to be treated uniformly.

  * [flyweight](flyweight/readme.md)
    - The invariant information are separated into two classes leading to savings in terms of the memory usage and the amount of time required to create a large number of instances.

  * [Iterator](iterator/readme.md)
    - Access the contents of a collection without having any knowledge about the internal representation of its contents.

  * [Visitor](visitor/readme.md)
    - Allows to add a operation to be defined across a collection of different objects without changing the classes of objects on which it operates.
